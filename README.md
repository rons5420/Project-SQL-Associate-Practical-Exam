## üè® LuxurStay Hotels - Room Service Analysis (SQL Practical Exam)

### üìã Project Overview

This SQL-based project was designed to help LuxurStay Hotels identify the root causes of slow room service in their branches across the globe. Management noticed a decline in customer satisfaction‚Äîfalling below their benchmark rating of 4.5‚Äîand asked for data-driven insights to guide improvements.

The analysis was performed across three interconnected tables:

* `Branch` ‚Äì Contains information about each hotel branch.
* `Request` ‚Äì Logs customer room service requests and ratings.
* `Service` ‚Äì Describes the type of service requested.

### üß† Tasks Completed

#### ‚úÖ **Task 1: Clean Branch Data**

We validated and cleaned the `Branch` table based on strict data integrity rules. This included:

* Replacing invalid or missing values
* Converting data types (e.g., strings to integers)
* Standardizing and sanitizing text fields

**Output:** A cleaned DataFrame called `clean_branch_data`.

#### ‚úÖ **Task 2: Service Time Analysis**

We calculated the **average** and **maximum** time taken to fulfill room service requests, grouped by both service and branch.

**Output Columns:**

* `service_id`
* `branch_id`
* `avg_time_taken`
* `max_time_taken`

**Output:** A DataFrame named `average_time_service`.

#### ‚úÖ **Task 3: Targeted Services in EMEA and LATAM**

We filtered for branches located in **EMEA** and **LATAM** that offered either **Meal** or **Laundry** services. This helps management prioritize improvements in regions where complaints were common.

**Output Columns:**

* `description` (service)
* `branch_id`
* `location`
* `request_id`
* `rating`

**Output:** A DataFrame named `target_hotels`.

#### ‚úÖ **Task 4: Identify Low-Rated Services**

We found all `branch_id` and `service_id` combinations where the **average customer rating** fell below the 4.5 satisfaction target.

**Output Columns:**

* `branch_id`
* `service_id`
* `avg_rating` (rounded to 2 decimal places)

**Output:** A DataFrame named `average_rating`.

### üíª Tech Stack

* **SQL** (PostgreSQL-style queries)
* **DataCamp Workspace** (or any SQL-enabled environment)
* **Relational Schema** with normalized tables

---

### üìé Notes

* All cleaning and filtering used **only the original raw data** unless otherwise specified.
* Regex (`~`) and type casting were used to prevent errors when validating data types.
* Aliasing (`WITH ... AS`) was used to match naming requirements from the tasks.
